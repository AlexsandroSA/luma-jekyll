Congratulations on setting up your new blog with **Luma**! You're now running a sleek, fast, and beautifully minimal Jekyll theme designed for developers and writers who appreciate clean aesthetics.

## Getting Started

This post lives in your `_posts` directory—feel free to edit or delete it. To see your changes instantly, run:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Your site will be available at `http://localhost:4000` and will auto-regenerate whenever you save a file.

## Creating New Posts

Adding content is simple. Create a new file in `_posts` following this naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-your-post-title.md
```

Each post needs front matter at the top:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: "Your Awesome Title"
---
```

## Syntax Highlighting

Luma comes with beautiful syntax highlighting out of the box. Here's an example:

{% highlight ruby %}
def greet(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}! Welcome to Luma."
end

greet('World')
#=> Hello, World! Welcome to Luma.
{% endhighlight %}

## What's Next?

- **Customize**: Edit `_config.yml` to personalize your site
- **Style**: Tweak `assets/css/style.scss` to match your brand
- **Write**: Start creating amazing content!
